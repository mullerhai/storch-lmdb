  /**
   * Ensures that the object referenced by the given reference remains <em>strongly reachable</em>,
   * regardless of any prior actions of the program that might otherwise cause the object to become
   * unreachable. Thus, the referenced object is not reclaimable by garbage collection at least
   * until after the invocation of this method.
   *
   * <p>Recent versions of the JDK have a nasty habit of prematurely deciding objects are
   * unreachable (eg <a href="https://tinyurl.com/so26642153">StackOverflow question 26642153</a>.
   *
   * <p><code>java.lang.ref.Reference.reachabilityFence</code> offers a solution to this problem,
   * but it was only introduced in Java 9. torch.lmdb presently supports Java 8 and therefore this
   * method provides an alternative.
   *
   * <p>This method is always implemented as a synchronization on {@code ref}. <b>It is the caller's
   * responsibility to ensure that this synchronization will not cause deadlock.</b>
   *
   * @param ref the reference (null is acceptable but has no effect)
   * @see <a href="https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8410">Netty PR 8410</a>
